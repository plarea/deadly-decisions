# Use microservices to orchestrate the multiple pieces to the application(s)

## Context and Problem Statement

We need to struture the differen aspects of the application.  How are we going to create & deploy our services?

## Considered Options

* microservices
* monolith

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "microservices", because
Lumping them into a single monolith makes more sense in this circumstance.  However to get greater experience in the software world microservices will be used to so I can try many different things.
